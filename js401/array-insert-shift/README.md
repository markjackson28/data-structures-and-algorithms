## Approach & Efficiency
> I first had to research on ways to approach this and I found that the .splice() method seem to be the most east to explain. `	.splice()` takes in a `(start, delete, item)`. The start would be what index position you want the item to go into. The delete has to be 0 if you want to keep the rest of the items. The item is the item you would want to insert at that ‘start/index’.
