# Stacks Queues Brackets

# Challenge Summary

- Write a function called validate brackets
- Arguments: string
- Return: boolean
  - representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced

- There are 3 types of brackets:
  - Round Brackets : ()
  - Square Brackets : []
  - Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to reference what I had done in the linked lists but for some reason I had to change the functions to reference an array. Once I did that, I was able to understand how to apply the functions to the two stacks. Some of the logic was a bit of guessing and messing around but I believe I got it to work. Still may need to come back to this to understand it more.

## Solution
- run `npm test`
