# Singly Linked List

## Challenge

* Create a Linked List class
* Within your Linked List class, include a head property.

  > Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

* The class should contain the following methods
* insert
  > Arguments: value

  > Returns: nothing

  > Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

* includes
  > Arguments: value

  > Returns: Boolean

  > > Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* to string
  > Arguments: none

  > Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:

  > "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach was to just follow the lecture. The demo was well laid out for the first parts. I did have to reference a bit online since some of this is still very new to me. It does seem like simple logic but applying it can be hard for me to comprehend. Overall, I was able to get the functions to work and tests to pass the functionality of each function.

## API
- `append`: append a node to the end of the list.
- `insert`: insert a new node to the head of the list.
- `includes`: tests to see if a value is within the list.
- `toString`: Outputs the values into a string. ex. "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
